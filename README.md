## Paper Preprint

This work has been submitted to IEEE RA-L. Please find the pre-print here:

[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/arxiv-%23B31B1B.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=arxiv&logoColor=white" />](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19393)

## Installation

Activate your conda/Python environment, clone and install `kinax`:

```azure
git clone git@github.com:anindex/kinax.git
cd kinax
pip install -e .
```

Then, navigate to `gtmp` root directory and install

```azure
pip install -e .
```

Please install [JAX with CUDA support](https://github.com/google/jax#installation) if you want to run the code on GPU.

## Examples

Please find in `examples/` folder the demo of vectorized planning in planar environments with occupancy map:

```azure
python examples/gtmp_occupancy.py
```

We also added a demo with vectorized Panda planning with [MBM Dataset](https://github.com/KavrakiLab/motion_bench_maker):

```azure
python examples/gtmp_mbm.py
```

Please see the `configs/` folder to select task and problem index.

**Tuning Tips**:

- `M`: the number of GTMP layer. In principle, we start tuning from `M = 1` since most problems are suprisingly can be solved with one layer. The minimum layer such that the problem can be solved is usually the optimal number of layer.
- `N`: the number of points per layer, which depends on the GPU memory. The more `N` the better in term of solvability, the worse computation time.
- `H`: the number of probing, which depends on the GPU memory. We set this moderately high depending on problem to ensure collision avoidance.
